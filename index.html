<h3>This website is secure, but Netlify's DNS is a bit funky, especially with <a href="http://noip.com">No-IP</a> for the domain 
  with the website being hosted on Github Pages. Luckily I applied the A and AAAA records, and that temporarily fixed the issue.
  I just dont know how to apply an SSL certificate to a domain name that only supports Dynamic DNS, which i'm using for this domain.
  Please teach me how to apply an SSL certificate to my domain name. My email is <a href="mailto:quasar.scratch@gmail.com">quasar.scratch@gmail.com</a>.
